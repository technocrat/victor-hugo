<p>My <a href="https://technocrat.github.io/">data science portfolio</a> shows analyses that I have performed from real-world data that I have wrangled myself (except where noted) and illustrates the range of tools I have in R, Python, MySQL, the standard bash utilities and statistics. As I pick up new techniques, I’ll be applying them there.</p>
