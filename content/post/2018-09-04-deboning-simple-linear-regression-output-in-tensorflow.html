<p>A simple linear regression example in TensorFlow(TM) is given at (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression" class="uri">https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression</a>). By default, it produces <em>none</em> of the outputs of linear regression, other than MAE or MSE, on request through a print statement.</p>
<pre><code>Testing set Mean Abs Error: $2788.86</code></pre>
<p>Time spent searching the documentation turned up no references to “intercept”, “coefficient”, “F-statistic”, “t-value,” or “p-value.”</p>
<p>I am only beginning to dip my toes into TensorFlow(TM). I suspect that it exists not so much as a suite of modeling tools so much as a platform to express them in n-dimensional space very efficiently. Like the output of the example itself, some users seem concerned only with the spread between the model prediction and results when testing (<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/2017/lectures/notes_03.pdf" class="uri">https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/2017/lectures/notes_03.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>There must be a way to use stats packages in Python to specify a model, pass it to TF, have it processed, and retrieve the full diagnostics. Otherwise, it seems too much like <em>trust me, would I … .</em></p>
