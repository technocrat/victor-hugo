The WSJ report of academic research on career hot streaks has snagged a lot of LinkedIn eyeballs today (Career 'hot steaks' are real 1h ago â€¢ 3,526 readers).

Reading the paper (https://goo.gl/2Mwqjn), you can see that it is an observational study of a convenience sample (these were the people about whom data were available, in the thousands or tens of thousands, an impressive collection).

Two mysteries: Why were the data not stratified into a training set and a test set? How could temporal auto-correlation fail to be addressed?

$f(x) = y$

isn't data science. And observational data of temporal patterns in somewhat simplistic metrics of an arbitrarily selected population tells you *menos de zero* about individuals outside the population. 

Finally, you need a theory to account for your results -- a chain of reasoning that takes you from what you see to what you can reliably predict with your shiny new analysis.

The academics have no robes, and I am failing adequately to defer to their superior credentials and posts.  Too bad, because I would liked to have learned something useful.
