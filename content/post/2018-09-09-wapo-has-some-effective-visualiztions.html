<p>One of the annoyances of online newspapers such as the NYT and WaPo is that they recycle content, usually off-the-news-cycle. But this sometimes gets offset by finding something you missed the first time.</p>
<p>In a recent article on <a href="https://wapo.st/2NwrDBw">six common occcupations that have changed from above-average to below average pay</a>, the 2018-09-04 article by Andrew Van Dam and Heather Long is illustrated by some effective techniques.</p>
<p>One technique is using the colors in the caption to serve as a legend to color coding in the graphic.</p>

<hr />
<p>The other is the use of two views of data separated by a caption giving the common variable identifications.</p>
