# Untidy happens

It's not always possible to store *everything* in a `tidy` but humongous data store. So, we have things like SQL foreign keys. 

Unfortunately, the database may not have been set up with future `tidy` in mind. Or, database access is only provided through CSV files.

Here's an example of what can happen. We begin with some basic information, as `tidy` as we could wish with not too much effort.

    > patients %>% select(KEY, AGE, ADULT, GENDER, SURVIVED)
    # A tibble: 3,065 x 5
          KEY   AGE ADULT GENDER SURVIVED
        <int> <int> <lgl> <chr>  <lgl>   
     1 238916    59 TRUE  Male   TRUE    
     2 193078    37 TRUE  Male   TRUE    
     3 580164    29 TRUE  Female TRUE    
     4 917895    82 TRUE  Female TRUE    
     5 376887    58 TRUE  Female TRUE    
     6 508153    35 TRUE  Male   TRUE    
     7 415059    21 TRUE  Male   TRUE    
     8 184182    24 TRUE  Female TRUE    
     9 318438    20 TRUE  Male   TRUE    
    10 508148    64 TRUE  Male   TRUE    
    # … with 3,055 more rows    

A separate file contains variables of interest

    > assessment
    # A tibble: 25,371 x 2
          KEY ASSESS
        <int>  <dbl>
     1 284827   922.
     2 284827   867 
     3 284827   835 
     4 284827   509.
     5 284827   508.
     6 284827   508.
     7 284827   506.
     8   4383   925.
     9   4383   919 
    10   4383   901 
    # … with 25,361 more rows
 
This is the dreaded *duplicate row* problem.
 
The `ASSESS` field in the larger tibble is the un`tidy` result of "oh, I have a new observation of a medical condition; let me record it along with the related patient," as opposed to "I have a patient with a new condition, let's add the condition."

Fortunately, the conditions are binary: a patient either has been diagnosed or not. This allows a some simple logic, after skipping over the addition of other data as shown in the source code.

We know we have an order of magnitude more records than subjects. Using an object, `injury` that has accumulated all this excess, we can do something about it.

    dedup_injury <- injury %>% group_by(KEY) %>% summarize_all(mean)
    injury <- dedup_injury %>% group_by(KEY) %>% mutate_if(is.double, as.logical)
    
In the first line we are taking the mean values of all columns with the same key. A male patient who is, say, 29, will have a mean `AGE` of 29, a logical mean of 1, meaning TRUE, for `GENDER`, etc. 

The second line is a bit trickier, but not much. Our hypothetical patient may have multiple diagnoses, which evaluate to true, and multiple diagnoses which evaluate to false. Each diagnosis has it's own column. If they are all false, the mean will be zero, or false. If the mean is one or greater, the mean will be one or more, true. Since we don't have a Boolean notion of *how true*, all that's needed is to coerce the result to a logical.

The following code puts the solution in context. It's mainly concerned with assembling relevant data from sources with different layout. I am grateful that I didn't have to construct an SQL query to reach the same results.
