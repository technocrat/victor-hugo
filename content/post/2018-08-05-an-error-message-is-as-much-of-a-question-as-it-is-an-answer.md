A [question](https://goo.gl/Z6jfuT) on datascience.stackexchange asked the reason for a Python syntax error

    SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
    
Another poster had the correct change to fix the error but the explanation didn't reflect what the OP needed to understand the problem behind the problem, which was failing to be namespace aware -- he was trying to perform an operation on an undefined object.

When you find the answer to a question you don't understand, you can expect to see it again.
