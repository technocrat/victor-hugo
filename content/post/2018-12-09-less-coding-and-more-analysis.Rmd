I urge you to `install.packages("ExPanDaR")` and then try the following:

<pre>
<code>
library(ExPanDaR)
wb <- read.csv("https://joachim-gassen.github.io/data/wb_condensed.csv")
ExPanD(wb, cs_id = "country", ts_id = "year")
</code>
</pre>

from [Interactive panel EDA with 3 lines of code](https://joachim-gassen.github.io/2018/12/interactive-panel-eda-with-3-lines-of-code/), which doesn't show the output to its best advantage, for which see [online demo](https://jgassen.shinyapps.io/expand_preston/)
