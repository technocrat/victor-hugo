<p>The compiler will always tell you about source code errors that prevent compiling. It can’t advise you if your code solves the problem that it was supposed to solve, even if you are confident in what that problem is. But have a thought for the user who posed the problem, and keep in mind two famous quotations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, programs must be executed for humans to read, only incidentially for machines to execute. – Harold Abramson, Gerald Jay Sussman, <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> - 2nd Edition, The MIT Press, 1966</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it? – Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger, <em>The Elements of Programming Style</em> - 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1978</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been helping a medical researcher who was given the following perfectly syntactical <code>R</code> code:</p>

<p>His request? Help me understand what this code does, because I don’t know how it got from the source data to the output data.</p>
<p>He had two obstacles to overcome that made mystification inevitable. He had no coding experience in the imperative/procedural style of <code>C, C++, Java, Python</code> and most other languages, and he was new to <code>R</code>. Now, he was reading code in <code>R</code>, a <strong>functional</strong> language, written primarily in an <strong>imperative</strong> style over 233 lines.</p>
<p>I thought that a more idiomatic version would clarify the data transformation. We talked of which <em>csv</em> files were of interest, what <em>variables</em> were important, what the output should look like and what the plans were for analyzing the data.</p>
<p>As a first cut, I returned 72 lines of more idiomatic <code>R</code> in the <code>tidyverse</code> style to look at a single year of the data.</p>

<p>That was something he was able to understand, and we have been working together to refine, possible because we now share a mutually intelligible language.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that I have no criticism of the programmer, the style of programming or the process that left the user in the dark. The lesson for everyone in the process of converting facts to data to data sets to programming objects is that mutual intelligibility is key.</p>
<p>We have run into some challenges that we are working to correct, inconsistent column naming conventions, data coding and similar routine issues. The major problem was the underlying data structure in which the same unit of observation, a patient, had multiple observations in multiple files, classic <code>untidy</code> data. Pulling all of the source data into a single data structure profilerated duplicate patient records that required a method to collapse into a single row.</p>
<p>That proved challenging for a surprising reason<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, about which more when the tentative solution has been more thoroughly tested.</p>
