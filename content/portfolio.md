My [data science portfolio](https://technocrat.github.io/_book) shows analyses that I have performed from real-world data that I have wrangled myself (except where noted) and illustrates the range of tools I have in R, Python, MySQL, the standard bash utilities and statistics. As I pick up new techniques, I'll be applying them there.
