      <description>Narcocorridos are a Mexican musical genre celebrating the drug trafficking culture. As you can read in wiki, it has a surprisingly long history and is popular despite official attempts to suppress it.
Stay with me, there’s a parable here about R, Python, DevOps, Bias Toward Action and leaving change on the table, in two senses.
A mild English flavor of a narcocorido is Townes van Zandt’s ballad Pancho and Lefty, his best known work in the pre-pop Country genre.</description>

      <description>This post makes a trio with two most recent blogs on the same subject for R and Excel, this time in Python usking the sklearn package.
The example given in the official documentation (https://goo.gl/GGmUKK) is somewhat sketchy and uses a different dataset than the previous two examples. Although the example dataset is different, my main purpose is to illustrate the default output.
 OLS Regression Results ============================================================================== Dep. Variable: y R-squared: 0.</description>
