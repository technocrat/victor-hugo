      <description>A while back (https://goo.gl/1W11Zu), I outlined interpretation of the output of a multiple linear regression of data on Seattle area housing prices (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?login=true), which provides a convenient way to illustrate the usual output of a multiple linear regression model output in R. This is a 21K dataset with 19 variables on housing characteristics and sales price. It’s a cruddy model, used solely to pick apart the different data presented. Today, it’s Excel’s turn.</description>

      <description>A simple linear regression example in TensorFlow&amp;trade; is given at (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression). By default, it produces none of the outputs of linear regression, other than MAE or MSE, on request through a print statement.
Testing set Mean Abs Error: $2788.86  Time spent searching the documentation turned up no references to &amp;ldquo;intercept&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;coefficient&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;F-statistic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;t-value,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;p-value.&amp;rdquo;
I am only beginning to dip my toes into TensorFlow&amp;trade;. I suspect that it exists not so much as a suite of modeling tools so much as a platform to express them in n-dimensional space very efficiently.</description>

      <description>This post makes a trio with two most recent blogs on the same subject for R and Excel, this time in Python usking the sklearn package.
The example given in the official documentation (https://goo.gl/GGmUKK) is somewhat sketchy and uses a different dataset than the previous two examples. Although the example dataset is different, my main purpose is to illustrate the default output.

      <description>I was recently puzzling over an academic paper in the social sciences with a multiple linear regression model that seemed off. (Communication with the authors educated me on considerations that resolved my concerns.)
During the course of my puzzling, I compared what I was seeing as model output in the paper and what I expected to see based on experience. The embarrassing revelation dawned that I didn’t actually know what all those components meant.</description>
