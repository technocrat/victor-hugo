      <description>## Please note: Alaska and Hawaii are being shifted and are not to scale. ## Getting data from the 2012-2016 5-year ACS ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## NAME = col_character(), ## Q22018_GDP = col_double() ## ) Color, Design and Communication Graphic design standards, especially for color, are an official Good Thing. Branding, visual cueing, consistency. Map colors are hard, especially when dealing with continuous data.</description>

      <description>Narcocorridos are a Mexican musical genre celebrating the drug trafficking culture. As you can read in wiki, it has a surprisingly long history and is popular despite official attempts to suppress it.
Stay with me, there’s a parable here about R, Python, DevOps, Bias Toward Action and leaving change on the table, in two senses.
A mild English flavor of a narcocorido is Townes van Zandt’s ballad Pancho and Lefty, his best known work in the pre-pop Country genre.</description>

      <title>R and Haskell, meant for each other?</title>

      <description>R has a notoriously steep learning curve. I once moaned that help() needed it’s own help(help), which it does, but did nothing to help me understand the paradigm of function signatures. And why were control loops like for so frowned upon. All sorts of great functionality, but how do you, like program it.
As I progressed in my ability to overcome my underlying lack of grok, I took a dip in Haskell, and discovered the concept of a functional language, essentially everything is \(f(x) = y\) as opposed to an imperative/procedural language – first do this, then do that, then perform some operation on both of them, and then, and then … .</description>

      <description>Here are questions you might want to ask about months: How many more months until September 1? months_to How many more calendar months until September 1? cal_months_to How many months between this month and September 1? months_between How many more calendar months between this month and September 1? cal_months_between In how many calendar months must I wait until September 1? months_inclusive  Assume we are asking the question on February 1 of a non-leap year.</description>

      <description>Keeping track of the provenance of data can be a challenge, especially when drawing on published sources. Keeping a record of the origin, the date accessed, the transformations applied (e.g., converting from .xls to cvs and converting character strings such as “$1,250,321.21” to floats or date strings to date objects), subsequent changes, who handled the data object and where it can be found in a repository are all things that enhance the analyst’s own ability to reproduce results.</description>

      <description>A while back (https://goo.gl/1W11Zu), I outlined interpretation of the output of a multiple linear regression of data on Seattle area housing prices (https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction?login=true), which provides a convenient way to illustrate the usual output of a multiple linear regression model output in R. This is a 21K dataset with 19 variables on housing characteristics and sales price. It’s a cruddy model, used solely to pick apart the different data presented. Today, it’s Excel’s turn.</description>
