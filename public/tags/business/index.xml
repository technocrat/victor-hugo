      <description>Arthur C. Clarke, best remembered for his screenwriting role in 2001: A Space Odyssey is also the source of a famous quotation
 Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
 We can think of data science as an advanced technology that draws heavily on statistics that have developed in the past decade to exploit the huge gains in power and reduction in cost of computing. Like any rapidly developing technology, approaches, methods, results and usefulness are all over the map.</description>
