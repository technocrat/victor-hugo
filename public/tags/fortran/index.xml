      <description>I had my first exposure to programming in a FORTRAN class with real punchcards, back in the day, before I knew that GOTO was considered harmful. The exposure was brief and left me wondering whether Russian verbs of motion might not be easier to study, after all.
In the years to follow, I ran the occasional canned deck with my datacards through overnight batch queues, but did not return to anything that could be called programming until I acquired an HP-25 calculator with a macro language, followed shortly by an HP-97 with little magnetic strips on which to record them.</description>
