      <description>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has lead responsibilities for protecting the United States against domestic crimes initiated abroad. These responsibilities include protection against “covert actions by foreign governments to influence U.S. political sentiment or public discourse” (https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/counterintelligence/foreign-influence). It has illustrated its mission description with a world map that appears to classify nations by the threats they pose.
The map has no description or legend, but uses several shades of blue to distinguish among countries.</description>

He gives a detailed critique of a precinct-by-precinct map of the 2016 presidential election, nationwide, showing the number of votes for Trump and Clinton and the nearest precinct in which the opposing candidate was in the majority.
He compares what the map purports to show with what it actually does show, which is the raw total of votes (ho-hum, we’ve known that for a long time) and the percentages.</description>
