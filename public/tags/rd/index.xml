      <description>Narcocorridos are a Mexican musical genre celebrating the drug trafficking culture. As you can read in wiki, it has a surprisingly long history and is popular despite official attempts to suppress it.
Stay with me, there’s a parable here about R, Python, DevOps, Bias Toward Action and leaving change on the table, in two senses.
A mild English flavor of a narcocorido is Townes van Zandt’s ballad Pancho and Lefty, his best known work in the pre-pop Country genre.</description>
