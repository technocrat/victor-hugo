      <p>Got <strong>n</strong>?</p>
<p><strong><em>There was a 100% increase in 1-hour parking meter costs this year!</em></strong></p>
<p>(Imagined conversation in a small town.)</p>
<p>It appears to be hardwired into our wetware to forget to look for the underlying integers. You might ask, for example <em>from what to what?</em> and learn that it went up from a nickle to a dime.</p>
<p>This is a manifestation what Daniel Kahneman, author of <em>Thinking Fast, and Slow</em> (2011, Ferrar, Straus and Giroux, New York) calls <em>The Law of Small Numbers.</em> Our favorite ballplayer has a <em>hot hand</em> (random variation), an image of a religious figure appears in the bird tracks on a beach (randonness doesn’t <em>look</em> uniform, there are all sorts of random patterns) and, the big tell, statistical finidings based on a small sample size, <strong><em>n</em></strong> are particularly vulnerable to random effects.</p>
<p>In one example the author gives as an example a survey of 1,662 schools in Pennsylvania. Of the top 50, six were small schools, about four times as many as you would expect to be exceptional. So, a well-known philantropist, joined by some famous foundations, set up a program to split larger schools up into smaller schools. If small schools do better than average, after all, it only makes sense.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, turning the question around, small schools <em>also</em> tend to have worse outcomes than average. The smaller schools, good, bad or indifferent, simply more variable.</p>
<p>Look for <strong><em>n</em></strong>, your first line of defense against putting your money where the facts aren’t.</p>
