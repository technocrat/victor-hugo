      <p>If you are a paying member of <a href="https:flowingdata.com">Flowing Data</a> (well worth the modest subscription), you will have received his email, reproduced at a <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2018/08/09/detailed-intentions/">paywalled</a> portion of the site.</p>

<p>He gives a detailed critique of a precinct-by-precinct <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/election-2016-voting-precinct-maps.html#10.95/47.678/-122.200/106446">map</a> of the 2016 presidential election, nationwide, showing the number of votes for Trump and Clinton and the nearest precinct in which the opposing candidate was in the majority.</p>

<p>He compares what the map purports to show with what it actually <em>does</em> show, which is the raw total of votes (ho-hum, we&rsquo;ve known that for a long time) and the <em>percentages.</em> What the map fails to show is <strong>population density</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More concretely, a 100-person precinct that voted 20 percent for Trump still had more Trump votes than a 10-person precinct that voted 100 percent for Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the larger precinct is &ldquo;blue,&rdquo; while the smaller precinct is &ldquo;red.&rdquo; But <em>twice</em> as red by headcount.</p>

<p>My own observation: Combined with our innate overperception of area and failing to weight voting results by percentage, we perceive a sea of red surrounding a few islands of blue. However, the national total blue vote was higher.</p>
