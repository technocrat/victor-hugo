    <div class="article-content">
      <p>The WSJ report of academic research on career hot streaks has snagged a lot of LinkedIn eyeballs today (Career &lsquo;hot steaks&rsquo; are real 1h ago â€¢ 3,526 readers).</p>

<p>Reading the paper (<a href="https://goo.gl/2Mwqjn">https://goo.gl/2Mwqjn</a>), you can see that it is an observational study of a convenience sample (these were the people about whom data were available, in the thousands or tens of thousands, an impressive collection).</p>

<p>Two mysteries: Why were the data not stratified into a training set and a test set? How could temporal auto-correlation fail to be addressed?</p>

<p>$$f(x)=y$$</p>

<p>isn&rsquo;t data science. And observational data of temporal patterns in somewhat simplistic metrics of an arbitrarily selected population tells you <em>menos de zero</em> about individuals outside the population.</p>

<p>Finally, you need a theory to account for your results &ndash; a chain of reasoning that takes you from what you see to what you can reliably predict with your shiny new analysis.</p>

<p>The academics have no robes, and I am failing adequately to defer to their superior credentials and posts.  Too bad, because I would liked to have learned something useful.</p>

<p>Reading further, there&rsquo;s no indication that the nominal prices were inflation adjusted. Whatever the latest auction price was recorded was used.</p>

<p>Cinema directors include assistant directors and art directors, who have primarily administrative, not creative, roles. The authors measure director  success by the IMDB user ratings. I don&rsquo;t know how IMDB handles it, but it&rsquo;s easy to imagine that as users come and go, and tastes change, the scores from that source may not share a common scale.</p>

<p>Academics get measured by citation. Often for good reason, a researcher will cite her previous related publications. Are those &ldquo;self-citations&rdquo; included or excluded?</p>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t even told whether the three measures of &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; were standardized to have a mean of 1 and standard deviation of 0.</p>

<p>The data and code, however, are provided at <a href="https://goo.gl/p8WYqH">https://goo.gl/p8WYqH</a>. Because the code won&rsquo;t load, due to a couple of type errors, the results can&rsquo;t be checks. Although scipy.stats is imported, it&rsquo;s not used, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that the data were standardized.</p>

<p>Such is <em>Nature,</em> I suppose.</p>
