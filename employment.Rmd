If you are a 501(c)(3) organization based in King County, WA, with data about your mission that requires quantitative analysis, I will undertake that as a volunteer without pay. It will, I hope, lead to greater insights on your mission and lend credibility to my resume by showing real-world experience.

If we undertake a discrete project together and I should be so fortunate to receive a job offer, I would make it contingent on completion of our project either before or during employment.

If interested, please contact me by direct message at https://linkedin.com/in/richardcareaga or to @technocrat on twitter.
