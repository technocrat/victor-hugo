If you are a 501(c)(3) organization based in King County, WA, with data about your mission that requires quantitative analysis, I will undertake that as a volunteer without pay. It will, I hope, lead to greater insights on your mission, and it will allow me a purpose for the expertise I have accumulated without the baggage of employment.

If you are located outside of my home base, I am still happy to lend a hand on light-weight projects that can resolved by email and telephone. I regret that I am unable to travel when that is required, however.

If interested, please contact me by direct message at https://linkedin.com/in/richardcareaga or to @technocrat on twitter.
